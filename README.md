Online image editor using HTML5/ FabricJS.
Technology i used:

Client side: HTML5, jQuery, Boostrap.

Server side: NodeJs, ExpressJS.

Credit: i used the CSS and HTML based on https://github.com/waqar-alamgir/html5-picture-editor.
However, i added: filter(color transformation), croping function, save and download to your computer.
And i want to try NodeJS and ExpressJS in sever side, so i rewrite backend function.
